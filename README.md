# thyroid-disease-prediction-using-ml
 Project Description

This project aims to predict thyroid disease using machine learning techniques based on patient clinical data. Thyroid disorders such as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism affect hormone balance and overall health. Early detection is important for effective treatment, and this system helps in predicting the condition accurately using data-driven models.

Objectives

1.To preprocess and analyze thyroid patient data

2.To apply machine learning algorithms for disease prediction

3.To compare model performance using evaluation metrics

4.To identify the most accurate prediction model
